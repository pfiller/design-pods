  The Inside Shapes collection, a collaboration between Shaw Contract and Form Us With Love, introduced a brand new concept in flooring that started by rethinking what a carpet tile could be. Instead of designing a product, it became a toolkit for others to design their own product.

  The toolkit concept was new (and a little confusing), so it needed clear communication around how it worked with a tone that gave designers and architects â€œpermission to play. The launch materials included everything from standard items like an Architect Folder and advertising to a showroom centered on the product and promotional materials.
