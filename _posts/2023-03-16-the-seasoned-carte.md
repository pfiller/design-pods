  The Seasoned Carte is a DTC company striving to offer restaurant-quality products from around the globe that are not easily accessible in local grocery store aisles. They had brand standards but needed to figure out how to implement them across social, email, and print. After in-depth conversations identifying their customers and the most effective channels, weâ€™ve rolled out monthly campaigns helping to boost impressions and sales.
