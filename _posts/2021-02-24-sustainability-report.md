  I worked with my friends at Porchlight to help design the 2017 Home Depot Sustainability Report.

  We wanted the report to have a real magazine feel with large images, graphic statistics, and plenty of “quick scan content.” The result was a bold and graphic book that made the social and environmental work Home Depot is doing stand out.
