  Shaw Contract launched three new collections at NeoCon 2019 that examined the impact of color in space: ReFrame, Dye Lab, and Gradation. For the launch, Shaw wanted to create a print piece that spoke to the narrative of color and which tied the collections together. For use in the print piece and showroom a series of photos weâ€™re produced covering the topics of inspiration, discovery, process, and texture.
