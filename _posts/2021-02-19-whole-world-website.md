  How do you capture the experience of improv with a website? Make it interactive and constantly changing. Whole World Improv wanted a website that was easy to use, highlighted all their shows and classes, and had a little bit of fun. The original concept was to allow users to interact with the site in a similar way they interact with the performers at the show. The main content would change every time the user clicked the button, giving an endless mash-up of fun phrases that always incorporated the three navigational elements: Atlanta, Ensemble, and Shows.

  This project was done with the bright folks at <a href="https://www.swarmagency.com">Swarm Agency</a>.
