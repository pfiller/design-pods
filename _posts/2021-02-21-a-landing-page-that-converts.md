  Orkin wanted to redesign its Landing Page to drive leads. After evaluating the user experience on the existing landing page, some common problems stood out. The page wasn’t focused on conversion, the user had lots of ways to exit the page, the value proposition wasn’t clear, and it was hard to submit a form.

  The page was redesigned, putting a big priority on the form’s location in the hero and ease of accessing it from anywhere on the page by including a sticky CTA at the bottom of the browser window. The results were clear. Form fills increased by 109%.

  This project was done with the bright folks at Swarm Agency.
