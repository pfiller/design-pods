  LPC is a personal project I worked on about riding bikes slow and eating snacks. It's really about embracing where you're at, even if that's dead last. I ride because it's fun, and my speed has nothing to do with it. I like the idea of wearing last place as a badge of honor. Life right now feels so urgent. The concept of slowing down, even if that means being last, makes me happy. A lot of life is showing up and doing the thing. If you can show up and have fun, even better. Even if you're last.
