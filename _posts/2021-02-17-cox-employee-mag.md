  Cox Enterprises sends out a quarterly magazine to all employees and retirees. The magazine readership has an extensive range in age, occupation, and interests.  Unlike a traditional quarterly publication that stays mostly the same from month to month, Cox wanted the magazine to change for every issue. They wanted to ensure it always felt fresh and new. This created for a fun design exercise. Besides the typeface and color palette, each issue had its own theme and look.
