  Shaw Contractâ€™s new Campus collection was inspired by the teachings of the Bauhaus, creating a dynamic collection that uses pattern and color in interchangeable ways. I worked with the product design team to develop photography assets and print materials for the product launch. This process started with the photography: location selection, space planning, styling recommendations, and day of shoot creative direction. Once the photography was complete, they were used for various marketing materials, including a product brochure.
