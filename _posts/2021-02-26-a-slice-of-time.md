  Harvest makes “Time tracking software for those who value insight.” As a promotional tool, Harvest created a video to showcase their product, customers, and what time means to them. The video focused on Paulie Gee’s pizza in Brooklyn and a designer working on a rebrand of the Paulie Gee’s identity. Harvest wanted to showcase a behind the scenes of the video and highlight the people, process, and locations from the video. They chose to do this with a fun one-page website.
