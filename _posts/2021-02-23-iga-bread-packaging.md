  <p class="work-services">Design</p>

  The new IGA packaging approach was to embrace the local, fresh promise at the center of IGA’s legacy. The design brings much-needed personality and style to the IGA brand while remaining true to its heritage.

  The bread packaging incorporated brand elements like the wheat icon and color palette to create a clear visual language for the products while also showcasing what’s in the package.
