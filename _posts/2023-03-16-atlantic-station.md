 Atlantic Station went through a rebrand in 2014 and had a shiny new brand they needed to execute across the property. All event and promotion graphics needed to be updated across the property and in social and advertising. Using the brand standards, we developed templates and sub-brands that made it easy and effective to activate on property.  Doing this allowed us to keep the look fresh and new but also feel on brand regardless of where it was used.
